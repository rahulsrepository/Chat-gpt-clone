<h1>
  CHATGPT CLONE
</h1>
<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>A ChatGPT clone is a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate chatbot interactions. The HTML defines the structural layout, while CSS styles it for a polished, user-friendly appearance. JavaScript handles the core logic, enabling dynamic user inputs, responses, and interactivity.

Although it lacks true AI processing unless connected to an API, such as OpenAI's GPT, the JavaScript implementation can mimic basic conversation flows with predefined rules or simple algorithms. If connected to an actual AI model, the frontend serves as a seamless interface for natural language interactions.

This project is an excellent demonstration of front-end development skills, combining design with functionality. It's ideal for beginners exploring chatbot functionality or developers prototyping interfaces, emphasizing efficient coding and user experience in lightweight frameworks.
